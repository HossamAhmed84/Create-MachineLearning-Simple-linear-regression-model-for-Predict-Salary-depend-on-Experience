Create-MachineLearning-Simple-linear-regression-model-for-Predict Salary depend on Years of Experience
- The goal in this project to obitain a relationship between Years of Experience As X and Salary as Y
- I tried to explain the Linear regression background and how it works.
- As the independent variable here only one variable, Simple linear regression is used as ML model
- calculate Y using linear equation y= m*X + b
- Read some test data from other file which need to predict salaries for it
